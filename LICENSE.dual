SCOPE OF LICENSING
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

1. Kernel Driver Components (under /driver):
   - Files such as adl-bmc.c, adl-bmc-gpio.c, adl-bmc-wdt.c, etc.
   - These are provided under a **dual BSD/GPL license**.
   - Reason: Linux kernel requires GPL compatibility. Users may treat the code
     as GPLv2 when linked into the kernel, or under BSD-3-Clause for broader reuse.

2. User-Space Library Components (under /lib):
   - Files such as gpio.c, fan.c, boardinfo.c, eapi.h, etc.
   - These are provided under the **BSD 3-Clause License** only.
   - Reason: User-space libraries do not link into the kernel and therefore
     do not require GPL terms. BSD-3-Clause gives customers maximum flexibility.

3. Applications / Utilities (under /app and /watchdogtest):
   - Example applications (main.c, watchdog-test.c).
   - These are provided under the **BSD 3-Clause License**.
   - Reason: Intended as sample code for customers to adapt freely.

4. Documentation (README, PDF guidelines):
   - Copyright © ADLINK Technology, Inc.
   - Provided for reference only; not covered by open-source licensing.

5. Certificates / Keys (signing_key.pem, cacert.pem, etc.):
   - Cryptographic material provided for demonstration/build purposes only.
   - Not subject to open-source licensing terms. Customers should generate
     their own production keys.
